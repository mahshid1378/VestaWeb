## Google Analytics Integration

The Google Analytics integration with VWI allows you to live monitor and manage the stats of your control panel.

### Google Analytics Setup

#### Step 1:
Create a new property within [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/), entering the VWI site as the website then hit 'Get Tracking ID'.

#### Step 2
Copy the tracking ID starting with 'UA-' and enter it into your VWI config. (Read the [Web Based Config](web-config#optional-integrations) or [Manual Config](manual-config#integrations) pages for info on how to do this.)


All Done!
